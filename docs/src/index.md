# TeaSeis

TeaSeis.jl is a Julia library for reading and writing JavaSeis files (The name `TeaSeis.jl` was chosen instead of `JavaSeis.jl` due to potential trademark issues).  The JavaSeis file format is used in various software projects including [SeisSpace](https://www.landmark.solutions/seisspace-promax).  The original library is written in [Java](http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaseis).  There are also [C++](http://www.jseisio.com>C++) and [Python](https://github.com/asbjorn/pyjavaseis) implementations available.  Similar to the C++ library, TeaSeis.jl is a stripped down version of the original Java library.  In particular, the intent is to only supply methods for reading and writing from and to JavaSeis files.
